			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<ul class="textalign"><h4>Travelling</h4>
			<p>I am have been passionate about travelling since very young. This passion turned into a life-changing experience when I studied abroad in Madrid, Spain and San Diego, USA. I have then realised its importance to foster one's open-mindedness. </p>

			<h4>Surfing</h4>
			<p>I became fond of surfing during my time abroad in San Diego. Now I try to keep up with this sport anytime I visit my family in the Basque country.</p>

			<H4>Books and Cinema</H4>
			<p>I love to read books and watch TV to foster my imagination: I have seen lots of movies. So much my friends often are suprised of my knowledge. As a hopeless romantic, I am also very keen on Jane Austen's books.</p></ul>
